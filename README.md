####Pre-Post Quantum Timing Averages (over 100 runs - single message) and Time Complexity of Operations:
**Pedersen Commitments:** 0.143 ms *O(n)* Time Complexity increasing linearly with *~0.140ms* increase per additional message
**Shuffle and Prove:** 0.150 ms *O(n)* Time Complexity increasing linearly with *~0.150ms* increase per additional message
**Subset Check:** 0.148ms *O(n)* Time Complexity increasing linearly with *~<0.001ms* increase per additional message and high starting overhead of *~0.148ms*
